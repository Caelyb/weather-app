# Getting Started with my Weather app

This is a weather dashboard with a city selected from a list or from user input and the current weather data is displayed as well as a 5 day forcast.
Material UI components and templates are used extensively.

# Dependencies

Before starting you should run:
npm i @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, @emotion/styled, @emotion/react, recharts

then use npm start to launch server

I have left my own Api key here for easy of use of any prospective employers to demo, This would not be done so when working on a serious project
